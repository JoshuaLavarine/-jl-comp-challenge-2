# Static Comp Challenge 2

Itâ€™s the middle of week five. This is one of two projects that are due after the Christmas break. Static Comp is a solo project, while Idea Box (due tomorrow) is a group project (three randomly assigned people per team)

# Goals 
- Improving from Static Comp Challenge 1
- Creating well structured, semantic HTML
- Creating clean, precise, and D.R.Y. ("Don't Repeat Yourself") CSS

# Motivation

I didn't go home for Christmas because I was concerned that I would get out of the habit of programming every day. That sacrifice will be worthwhile if I am successful in Mod 1 (exams are next week).  

# Built with

- Sublime
- DevTools on Google Chrome Canary
- DevTools on Firefox Developer Edition

# Languages Built in 

- HTML
- CSS

# Shortcomings

This is a repeated shortcoming: I believe that I focused too much time on my paired project (due the day after this project). I need to do better time-boxing my work in order to spread my attention evenly on all of my tasks.
